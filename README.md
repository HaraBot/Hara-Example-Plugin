# Hara-Example-Plugin

An example Lua plugin for Hara the Discord bot.

Information on methods and other goodies can be found on the [Hara wiki](https://github.com/jammehcow/Hara/wiki)

## What is that config used for and why do I need it?

When enabling a plugin Hara takes those required keys' values and creates a description from them. This description can then be accessed by other plugins if need be, but most important of all, Hara will display this info in a nice embed when ```!info [pluginname]``` (substitute ! for you bot prefix) is called.

The embed lets users know who made the plugin, gives them a list of commands with usages and other additional information they may find useful.
